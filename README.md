## Dev setup

Before you start developing, you need some one-time setups.

You need ``node.js`` installed. You can install it directly from the Node.js page, or you can use Homebrew if you have that installed:

```bash
    brew install node
```

You also need ``volta`` for version control. Again, you can install from the homepage, or use Homebrew:

```bash
    brew install volta
```

## Dev workflow

To get started developing, install the app from the project files:

```bash
    npm install
```

Then, to start the app locally, run:

```bash
    npm start
```
