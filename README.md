## Dev setup

You need ``node.js`` installed. You can install it directly from the Node.js page, or you can use Homebrew if you have that installed:

```bash
    brew install node
```

You also need ``volta`` for version control. Again, you can install from the homepage, or use Homebrew:

```bash
    brew install volta
```

## Dev workflow

To get started, install the app from the project files:

```bash
    npm install
```
